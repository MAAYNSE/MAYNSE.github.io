        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The passive voice is used in English to focus attention on 
            the action or the object receiving the action, rather than on
             the subject performing the action. It is formed with the verb 'to be' 
             and the past participle of the main verb.</p>
             <h3>When is passive voice used?</h3>
             <p> Passive voice is used when the subject of the sentence 
                is an object or thing that is acted upon. For example, 
                consider a pizza. A pizza (as the subject of a sentence) 
                can be expensive, taste good, have many ingredients, etc.
                 However, there is a limit to the sentences we can make with 
                 a pizza as a subject, since it is still an object that does
                  not perform actions itself. That's when the passive voice
                  comes into play.</p>

        <h2>Grammar</h2>
        <p>The basic structure of a passive voice sentence is:</p>
        <p><strong>Subject + Verb 'to be' (in the appropriate tense) 
            + Past participle of the main verb + complement.</strong></p>
        <p>Example: The cake was eaten (by John).</p>
